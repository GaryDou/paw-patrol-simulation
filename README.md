# Paw Patrol for Penguins üêßüêæ

## Project Overview
This project is a simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of employing specially trained dogs to protect fairy penguins at the penguin reserve on Phillip Island, Victoria. The program models the survival of penguin colonies under varying levels of dog protection, accounting for natural predator threats.

### Background
Fairy penguins on Phillip Island face threats from both land and sea predators, including foxes, cats, and sharks. A local Paw Patrol group proposed training dogs to guard penguin colonies, as similar methods have been successful in other regions. This simulation explores the potential outcomes of employing one or two trained dogs to protect the colony.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> This project is inspired by real-world conservation efforts. However, the data and calculations used in this simulation are hypothetical and are not based on actual field studies. The program was developed as a university assignment to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts in Java. It is not intended to reflect the actual effectiveness of using dogs for penguin protection.

## Features üöÄ
- **Simulation of Penguin Colony Survival:**  
  Simulates one year of penguin colony survival, accounting for monthly events such as egg-laying, hatching, and predator attacks.  
- **Different Levels of Dog Protection:**  
  Choose between no protection, one dog, or two dogs to see the impact on penguin survival.  
- **Dynamic Colony Changes:**  
  Updates the colony state monthly, tracking the number of penguins, chicks, and eggs.  
- **Predator Impact Calculation:**  
  Models predator attacks (foxes, cats, sharks) with varying probabilities based on dog protection levels.  
- **Result Summary:**  
  At the end of the simulation, reports penguin, chick, egg, and overall colony survival rates.

- **Object-Oriented Concepts:** Encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism  
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, ArrayLists  
- **File Handling:** Reads initial data from `colony.txt` and writes results to `colonyFinal.txt`
